## üöÄ Description

Spatial confounding poses a significant challenge in scientific studies involving spatial data, where unobserved spatial variables can influence both treatment and outcome, possibly leading to spurious associations. To address this problem, SpaCE provides realistic benchmark datasets and tools for systematically evaluating causal inference methods designed to alleviate spatial confounding. Each dataset includes training data, true counterfactuals, a spatial graph with coordinates, and a smoothness and confounding scores characterizing the effect of a missing spatial confounder. The datasets cover real treatment and covariates from diverse domains, including climate, health and social sciences. Realistic semi-synthetic outcomes and counterfactuals are generated using state-of-the-art machine learning ensembles, following best practices for causal inference benchmarks. SpaCE facilitates an automated end-to-end machine learning pipeline, simplifying data loading, experimental setup, and model evaluation.


## üêç Installation

Install the PyPI version:

```sh
pip install spacebench[all]
```
The option `[all]` installs all dependencies necessary for the spatial confounding algorithms and the examples. If you only want to use the `SpaceDatasets`, use `pip install spacebench` instead.

You can also install the latest üî• features from the development version:

``` sh
pip install "git+https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects/space@dev#egg=spacebench[all]"
```

Python 3.10 or higher is required. See the [docs](https://nsaph-projects.github.io/space/) and `requirements.txt` for more information.

## üê¢ Getting started

To obtain a benchmark dataset for spatial confounding you need to 1) create a `SpaceEnv` which contains real treatment and confounder data, and a realistic semi-synthetic outcome, 2) create a `SpaceDataset` which masks a spatially-varying confounder and facilitates the data loading pipeline for causal inference.


```python
from spacebench import SpaceEnv
env = SpaceEnv('healthd_dmgrcs_mortality_disc')
dataset = env.make()
print(dataset)
```
```
SpaceDataset with a missing spatial confounder:
  treatment: (3109,) (binary)
  confounders: (3109, 30)
  outcome: (3109,)
  counterfactuals: (3109, 2)
  confounding score of missing: 0.02
  spatial smoothness score of missing: 0.11
  graph edge list: (9237, 2)
  graph node coordinates: (3109, 2)
  parent SpaceEnv: healthd_dmgrcs_mortality_disc
WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è : this dataset contains a (realistic) synthetic outcome!
By using it, you agree to understand its limitations.  The variable
names have been masked to emphasize that no  inferences can be made
about the source data.
```


 The list of available environments can be in the documentations or in an interactive session as:

```python
from spacebench import DataMaster
dm = DataMaster()
dm.master.head()
```


| environment                           | treatment_type | collection                            |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| healthd_dmgrcs_mortality_disc     | binary         | Air Pollution and Mortality           |
| cdcsvi_limteng_hburdic_cont       | continuous     | Social Vulnerability and Welfare      |
| climate_relhum_wfsmoke_cont       | continuous     | Heat Exposure and Wildfires           |
| climate_wfsmoke_minrty_disc       | binary         | Heat Exposure and Wildfires           |


To learn more about the data collections and the environments see the [docs](https://nsaph-projects.github.io/space/). The data collections and environments are hosted at the [Harvard Dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SYNPBS). "Data "nutrition labels" for the collections can be found [here](https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects/space-data/tree/main/data). The environments are produced using the [space-data](https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects/space-data) repository from a data collection with a [configuration file](https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects/space-data/tree/main/conf/spaceenv). Don't forget to read our paper.
