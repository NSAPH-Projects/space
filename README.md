## üöÄ Description

SpaCE loads benchmark datasets for causal inference that incorporartes spatial confounding. The **SpaCE** datasets contain real confounder and exposure/treatment data inspired by environmental health studies. The synthetic outcome and counterfactuals are generated for causal evaluation. They mimick real outcome data distributions learned with machine learning and neural network methods. Spatial confounding is achieved by masking influential confounders in the learned model. 


## üêç Installation

Install PyPI version:

```sh
pip install spacebench
```

Or the latest version from GitHub:

``` sh
pip install git+https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects/space
```

For access to the üî• features install the development version:

``` sh
pip install git+https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects/space@dev
```

We recommend Python 3.10 or higher. See the [docs](https://nsaph-projects.github.io/space/) and `requirements.txt` for more information.
