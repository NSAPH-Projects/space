medisynth,"We present steps to generate public data sets for benchmarking and illustration purposes for air pollution and health studies. In most of these studies, the health care data cannot be shared with the public; as a result, there are no public data sets to be used as benchmark data set for testing the packages or illustrating their functionalities. CMS has generated synthetic data for the 2008-2010 range for Medicare data. This report uses these data, census, and exposure data to compile the study data set.",,"census,cdc,nasa,gridmet,cms",,https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects/synthetic_data,no
